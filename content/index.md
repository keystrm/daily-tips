### Key Points:

- **Front Matter**: The YAML block at the top (`---`) is known as front matter, often used in static site generators to store metadata.
- **Headers**: Use `#` symbols to create headers. More `#` symbols mean a lower level header.
- **Formatting**: Asterisks (`*`), underscores (`_`), and tildes (`~`) are used for italic, bold, and strikethrough text.
- **Lists**: Create bullet lists using dashes (`-`) and numbered lists with numbers followed by a dot (`1.`).
- **Links and Images**: Use square brackets for link text and round brackets for URLs. Images are similarly formatted but start with an exclamation mark.
- **Code**: Use backticks for inline code and triple backticks for code blocks. Specify the language after the triple backticks for syntax highlighting.
- **Blockquotes**: Use the `>` symbol.
- **Tables**: Organize data with pipes (`|`) and dashes (`-`).
- **Horizontal Rules**: Use three dashes (`---`).
