# Introduction to Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

## Basics

Here are the basic syntax elements for Markdown:

### Headers

Headers are created by using the `#` symbol before your header text. The number of `#` you use will determine the size of the header.

```markdown
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6
