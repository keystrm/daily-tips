# Browser Storage Options Overview

## Local Storage
- **Persistence:** Data persists after browser closes.
- **Capacity:** ~5MB.
- **Accessibility:** Same-origin.
- **Use Cases:** Storing user preferences and themes.

## Session Storage
- **Persistence:** Data cleared when browser tab closes.
- **Capacity:** ~5MB.
- **Accessibility:** Same-origin, same tab.
- **Use Cases:** Temporary data like form states.

## IndexedDB
- **Persistence:** Data persists after browser closes.
- **Capacity:** No fixed limit, much larger than Local/Session Storage.
- **Accessibility:** Same-origin.
- **Use Cases:** Large amounts of structured data, offline data access.

## Cookies
- **Persistence:** Configurable (minutes to years).
- **Capacity:** ~4KB.
- **Accessibility:** Can be configured for server-only or server and client.
- **Use Cases:** Session management, user tracking, and personalization.

## Other Storage Options
- **WebSQL:** Deprecated, lacks cross-browser support.
- **Cache Storage:** Part of Service Workers, stores network requests/responses.
- **FileSystem API:** Allows read/write access to a sandboxed file system, mainly supported in Chrome.

## Comparisons and Considerations
- **Privacy and Security:** Cookies can pose security risks if improperly configured.
- **Performance:** IndexedDB provides asynchronous access, improving performance.
- **Storage Limitations:** Each method has its own limitations; choice depends on data amount and type.
