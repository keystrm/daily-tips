# gRPC Overview

![gRPC Diagram](/img/gprc.webp)

gRPC is an open-source, high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework that enables seamless communication between client and server applications. It is designed to be modern and efficient, suitable for use in diverse environments.

## Key Features

- **Language Agnostic**: Works with multiple programming languages, facilitating interoperability.
- **HTTP/2 Based**: Utilizes HTTP/2 features like streaming, multiplexing, and server push.
- **Protocol Buffers**: Employs Protocol Buffers for defining method signatures and structured data.
- **Streaming Support**: Supports bidirectional streaming for dynamic data exchange.
- **Pluggable Features**: Offers extensions for authentication, load balancing, and more.

gRPC is ideal for building connected systems, particularly in microservices architectures, due to its robustness and performance efficiencies.
