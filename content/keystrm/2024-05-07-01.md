# An Introduction to Semantic Versioning

Semantic versioning is a guideline system that helps developers, project managers, and consumers universally understand the release process, particularly indicating if a change will break existing code. Most major projects on GitHub adhere to this system.

## Major Version
- Indicates backwards-incompatible changes.
- Resets minor and patch versions (e.g., 1.23.11 becomes 2.0.0).

## Minor Version
- Adds new features without breaking existing API.
- Resets patch version (e.g., 1.23.11 becomes 1.24.0).

## Patch Version
- Used for bug fixes without functional changes (e.g., 1.23.11 becomes 1.23.12).

## Pre-releases and Build Metadata
- Used for informal releases to test users, often unstable.
- Includes identifiers like beta tags and build data (e.g., 1.23.11-beta.1+nialljoemaher-2bf235).
