# Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Overview
Dijkstra's Algorithm is a graph-searching method used to find the shortest path from a starting node (source) to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative weights.

## How It Works
1. **Initialization**: Start at the source node and assign it a distance of zero. Set the distance to all other nodes as infinity.
2. **Relaxation**: For the current node, consider all its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.
3. **Update**: After considering all the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.
4. **Iteration**: Move to the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance and repeat the process.

## Features
- **Performance**: The algorithm runs in O(V^2) time using a simple array, where V is the number of vertices. Using priority queues can improve this to O((V+E) log V).
- **Applications**: Used in various applications like network routing, map navigation, and as a subroutine in other graph algorithms.

## Example Use
Finding the shortest path in road networks for GPS navigation.
